## Control Glove: Precisely Tracking Finger Movements with Potentiometers

Control Glove is a smart glove designed to accurately monitor finger movements using potentiometers and transmit this data to a central device powered by an ESP32-based board. The primary objective of this project is to provide a tool for precise tracking of finger movements and the transfer of this data to a central device.

### Key Features:
- Equipped with potentiometers for precise tracking and measurement of finger movements.
- Utilizes an ESP32-based board to gather and transmit the finger movement data.
- Designed for accurate and real-time monitoring.
- Customizable and open-source, allowing you to adapt the project to your specific needs.

### How to Use the Project:
1. Put on the Control Glove to begin tracking finger movements.
2. The ESP32-based board collects and processes the finger movement data.
3. Transmits the data to a central device for further analysis.
4. Ensures precise and real-time monitoring of finger movements.
5. The project can be customized to meet your specific requirements.
